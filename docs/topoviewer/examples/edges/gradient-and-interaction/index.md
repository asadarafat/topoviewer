# Gradient and interaction flags

Linear gradients are useful for directional utilization, ownership, or state transitions. `interactive: false` leaves a reference edge visible while removing edge click handling, and `labelInteractive: false` keeps labels from taking pointer events.

## Expected Result

Linear gradients and interaction flags can be declared directly on edge style rules.

## Try It

1. Copy the two YAML tabs into your own project. In stylesheet.yaml, find selector `link[labels.mode = "reference"]`.
2. Change its `lineColor` from `"#94a3b8"` to `"#e11d48"`, then reload your page. Compare the color of objects matching that selector; their IDs and relationships should stay unchanged.
3. If another rule masks the edit, check its specificity in the [stylesheet guide](../../../reference/topoviewer-stylesheet.md). Restore the original value to compare the two views.
