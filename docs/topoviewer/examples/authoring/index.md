# Authoring

Explore authoring behavior with a live diagram and its two source files. Each example includes an edit to try in your own copy.

## Layered network authoring

The default compact Studio authoring fixture.

It combines underlay, BGP, service, and operations layers in one small topology so Studio and regression checks can exercise layer toggles, relationship editing, attention, and diagnostics without starting from an empty graph.

### Expected Result

A compact layered-network fixture for Studio, demos, and regression checks.

### Try It

1. Copy the two YAML tabs into your own project. In stylesheet.yaml, find selector `region`.
2. Change its `borderColor` from `"rgba(25, 118, 210, 0.34)"` to `"#e11d48"`, then reload your page. Compare the color of objects matching that selector; their IDs and relationships should stay unchanged.
3. If another rule masks the edit, check its specificity in the [stylesheet guide](../../reference/topoviewer-stylesheet.md). Restore the original value to compare the two views.

## CLOS 2-spine 4-leaf

A compact **2-spine, 4-leaf CLOS** fixture using `layout.mode: clos`.

- 2 spine nodes
- 4 leaf nodes
- 8 full-mesh fabric links (each leaf to both spines)
- no manual node positions
- no `stageKey` or `inferLabelRole`
- stages are inferred from directed `source` -> `target` fabric links
- `labels.node` only drives styling, icons, and outlines

Use this fixture as the smallest practical automatic-layout example. If a real
topology uses undirected or mixed-direction links, add a dedicated stage field
and reference it with `layout.clos.stageKey`.

### Expected Result

A compact data center fabric template with two spine switches, four leaf switches, and full leaf-to-spine mesh links.

### Try It

1. Copy the two YAML tabs into your own project. In stylesheet.yaml, find selector `link`.
2. Change its `lineColor` from `"#42a5f5"` to `"#e11d48"`, then reload your page. Compare the color of objects matching that selector; their IDs and relationships should stay unchanged.
3. If another rule masks the edit, check its specificity in the [stylesheet guide](../../reference/topoviewer-stylesheet.md). Restore the original value to compare the two views.

## Insert workflow

A Studio authoring fixture for adding nodes, links, regions, paths, and notes from the object palette.

The graph keeps every declared layer populated so layer toggles remain useful while authoring.

### Expected Result

A Studio fixture for inserting nodes, links, paths, regions, and notes.

### Try It

1. Copy the two YAML tabs into your own project. In stylesheet.yaml, find selector `region`.
2. Change its `borderColor` from `"rgba(66, 165, 245, 0.58)"` to `"#e11d48"`, then reload your page. Compare the color of objects matching that selector; their IDs and relationships should stay unchanged.
3. If another rule masks the edit, check its specificity in the [stylesheet guide](../../reference/topoviewer-stylesheet.md). Restore the original value to compare the two views.

## Attention workflow

A Studio authoring fixture for editing attention behavior against a small multi-layer service topology.

Use it to exercise object focus, path focus, dense link grouping, and region aggregation.

### Expected Result

A Studio fixture for editing attention focus, aggregation, and link grouping.

### Try It

1. Copy the two YAML tabs into your own project. Select the same layers in the viewer: `underlay`, `service`, `operations`. In stylesheet.yaml, find selector `region`.
2. Change its `borderColor` from `"rgba(66, 165, 245, 0.58)"` to `"#e11d48"`, then reload your page. Compare the color of objects matching that selector; their IDs and relationships should stay unchanged.
3. If another rule masks the edit, check its specificity in the [stylesheet guide](../../reference/topoviewer-stylesheet.md). Restore the original value to compare the two views.

## Inspector workflow

A Studio authoring fixture for inspecting and editing object labels, data, positions, and relationship endpoints.

The topology includes routers, a firewall, a service, links, and a callout so the Inspect panel has varied object types.

### Expected Result

A Studio fixture for inspecting object labels, data, positions, and relationships.

### Try It

1. Copy the two YAML tabs into your own project. In stylesheet.yaml, find selector `link[labels.layer = "security"]`.
2. Change its `lineColor` from `"#d32f2f"` to `"#e11d48"`, then reload your page. Compare the color of objects matching that selector; their IDs and relationships should stay unchanged.
3. If another rule masks the edit, check its specificity in the [stylesheet guide](../../reference/topoviewer-stylesheet.md). Restore the original value to compare the two views.

## Dense link grouping

A compact Studio fixture for parallel links and link grouping.

Use it to tune bundle threshold behavior without loading a large topology.

### Expected Result

A Studio fixture for parallel link grouping and bundle threshold editing.

### Try It

1. Copy the two YAML tabs into your own project. In stylesheet.yaml, find selector `link[labels.layer = "observability"]`.
2. Change its `lineColor` from `"#2e7d32"` to `"#e11d48"`, then reload your page. Compare the color of objects matching that selector; their IDs and relationships should stay unchanged.
3. If another rule masks the edit, check its specificity in the [stylesheet guide](../../reference/topoviewer-stylesheet.md). Restore the original value to compare the two views.
