# Icon fit and badges

Icon fit, badges, and status markers let a small node carry asset, count, and health cues. Use badges for compact values and status markers for color-coded state.

`iconFit` accepts `contain`, `cover`, and `fill`. This example uses the same wide SVG in a circular node for all three nodes: `contain` preserves the whole SVG with empty space, `cover` crops the wide SVG to fill the circular node body, and `fill` stretches the SVG across the circular node body. The demo SVG opts into stretching with `preserveAspectRatio="none"` so the `fill` behavior is visible.

## Expected Result

Icon fit, badges, and status markers add compact node-level signals.

## Try It

1. Copy the two YAML tabs into your own project. In stylesheet.yaml, find selector `link`.
2. Change its `lineColor` from `"#94a3b8"` to `"#e11d48"`, then reload your page. Compare the color of objects matching that selector; their IDs and relationships should stay unchanged.
3. If another rule masks the edit, check its specificity in the [stylesheet guide](../../../reference/topoviewer-stylesheet.md). Restore the original value to compare the two views.
