# Label z-index

Use `labelZIndex` when labels need their own draw order without moving the object body, edge line, or region hull. The region label, edge label, endpoint labels, and node labels in this example intentionally use separate label layers.

## Expected Result

Labels can draw in their own layer without changing object, edge, or region draw order.

## Try It

1. Copy the two YAML tabs into your own project. In stylesheet.yaml, find selector `region`.
2. Change its `borderColor` from `"var(--topoviewer-region-stroke)"` to `"#e11d48"`, then reload your page. Compare the color of objects matching that selector; their IDs and relationships should stay unchanged.
3. If another rule masks the edit, check its specificity in the [stylesheet guide](../../../reference/topoviewer-stylesheet.md). Restore the original value to compare the two views.
