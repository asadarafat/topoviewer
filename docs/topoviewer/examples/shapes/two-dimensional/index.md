# Two-dimensional shapes

2D shapes are annotation primitives. They remain separate from graph nodes, while topology labels provide stable selector facts and the stylesheet owns visual geometry and dimensions.

## Expected Result

2D geometry primitives are diagram objects, not graph facts.

## Try It

1. Copy the two YAML tabs into your own project. In stylesheet.yaml, find selector `shape`.
2. Change its `borderWidth` from `2` to `4`, then reload your page. Compare the stroke thickness of objects matching that selector; their IDs and relationships should stay unchanged.
3. If another rule masks the edit, check its specificity in the [stylesheet guide](../../../reference/topoviewer-stylesheet.md). Restore the original value to compare the two views.
